1) IR_col is one column of size 1xm that maybe big. Same for buffer.
   Can we read and write to extrenal memory? Can we have one argument in the function that is input & output?
2) We cannot do testing..is that a problem? We can test only if the algorithm converges but not the value of the solution.
3) Unroll and pipeline --> by hand?
4) Latency or Area? (3400 latency, 5500 area --> 4x4)

5) Unroll all except from TIME, (INNER_PRODUCT ?)
   TIME --> pipeline 3
   MOVIE --> unroll but increases area too much
