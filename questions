Optimizations
  
   INNER_PRODUCT --> partial unroll 2 + pipeline(II=1)  --> Throughput: 4006, Area: 5276
   unroll more than 2 is not useful because we can read at most 2 values per cycle
   
   MOVIES --> pipeline 1
   
   TIME --> cannot be pipelined (TIME has 2 cycles (one that does MOVIES+UPDATE_IR and one that increments i for the loop)
   TIME --> cannot be unrolled because we have dependency on data(and they cannot be paralleled)
   
   IR_COL_INIT --> partial unroll 2, pipeline 1
   WRITE_OUTPUT --> partial unroll 2, pipeline 1
   UPDATE_IR --> partial unroll 2, pipeline 1
   
   USER --> no optimization
   if we do unroll 2 to user and pipeline to inner loops then we get more cycles(total thoughtput cycles: 2200)
